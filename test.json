Adler and nuclear physicist Edward Teller.\n\nAs his work continued well into the 80‚Äôs, Lee had expanded his stretch in the mediums of advertising and portrait photography. One such notable portrait of famed hat designer, Stephen Jones landed him
the Ilford Advertising Award. The portrait would also be know as the first triptych shot to be done with 6 x 17 Linhof Technorama. This style of shooting would soon become the favourite of Fugi Film Co. President Minoru Ohnishi which would result in

There he studied in Photographic Arts at Ryerson Polytechnical Institute. After graduating at the top of his class of 1972 he traveled for 10 months through Europe. After his travels, he received a grant from the Canadian Arts Council to photograph
the beachside town of Brighton in England. After falling for the beauty of the country, he established the Benjamin Lee Studio in London in 1977 where he continued his work.\n\nWith his new base of operations, he began receiving advertising
commissions from such brands as Carlsberg Beer, National Panasonic, Olympus and Bayer. He also received a commission by W.H.O. to photograph English abstract sculptor Henry Moore, classical harmonica player Laurence Cecil Adler and nuclear physicist
Edward Teller.\n\nAs his work continued well into the 80‚Äôs, Lee had expanded his stretch in the mediums of advertising and portrait photography. One such notable portrait of famed hat designer, Stephen Jones landed him the Ilford Advertising Award.

work by David Bailey is of one of his main muses Diana Vreeland. \n\nDiana Vreeland (September 29, 1903 ‚Äì August 22, 1989) was a noted columnist and editor in the field of fashion. She worked for the fashion magazines Harper's Bazaar and Vogue,
being the editor-in-chief of the latter, and as a special consultant at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She was named on the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1964.\n\nThis is the only digital version of this
image ever to be sold and marks a historic moment in art and blockchain. The seeds of beauty series is a celebration of female beauty inspired by the Victorian seed packet designs.\n\nFrom his 60‚Äôs Box of Pinups to Stardust (2014) and everything
else in between, David Bailey is an undisputed British icon. There is so much\nthat can be said about Bailey and his continuous work over the decades but here we are focusing predominantly on his most recent work.\n\nBailey's vision has always
extended far beyond his portrait and fashion photography, he is an explorer at heart, whether it be for far reaching\nlocations like Naga Land or the internal reflections of the human condition. Bailey seems to extract core emotion out of his
subjects in a way\nthat shows their inner beauty or the monster that can hide within. Those Bailey chooses to photograph often find themselves seeing things\nabout themselves from a new angle.\n\nBailey's‚Äô Paintings take on a different tone to his
photography, he lays bare his innermost turmoil for the world to see. Bailey‚Äôs childhood\nfears often take centre stage in his paintings, scenes of Hitler looming over bombed out dream scapes being a common motif. These are often\nthought provoking
musings on the nature of memory damaged by an external force.\n\nThe other side of David's painting is primal in nature, in these pieces he attempts to clear his mind, leaving his ego behind. In both styles there is a sense of dystopian surrealism,
sometimes\ndisturbing and sometimes humorous in which Bailey reflects on his past and his present in interesting and surprising
ways.\n\n","artworkGradeId":"fd2765b9-ed60-4a4d-8416-2818afa8db13","artworkGrade":{"artworkType":"DigitalArtwork","megaPixelGrade":"A","colorMetricGrade":"None","dpiGrade":"D","fileTypeGrade":"A","codecGrade":"None","resolutionGrade":"None","bitrateGrade":"None","overallGrade":"B","id":"fd2765b9-ed60-4a4d-8416-2818afa8db13","dateModified":"2019-01-15T09:43:46.058353","dateCreated":"2019-01-10T16:47:34.927284"},"artworkType":"DigitalArtwork","dateCompleted":"2018-01-01T00:00:00","readyToTransfer":1,"printCount":0,"printsRemaining":0,"price":5000,"basePrice":0,"minimumBid":0,"feeLevel":0,"baeFeeLevel":0,"isForSale":False,"isPublic":True,"id":"32b3ba62-4947-455a-b79a-022668cedde9","dateModified":"2019-02-04T13:31:26.12028","dateCreated":"2019-01-10T16:47:34.927148"},{"name":"David

some form of creative expression. At the age of 16 Jack attended the highly regarded music college ACM, where he received a first year degree. Jack Daniels never wanted to complete a full degree seeing in it nothing more, than a waste of money and
time. Deciding instead to forge his own path in the world.\n\nJack has created his own artworks for his album covers since he launched his first E.P. ‚ÄúAlways Late‚Äù. Thomson being the entrepreneur he is also decided to create his own clothing line,
called Roman Republic at the age of 17.\nThompsons work has evolved greatly from its beginnings. Slowly coming to the conclusion that making lightboxes was the best form for his art to take. The process is simple yet effective first he creates a
unique multi layered image using a mixture of Photoshop and other mediums. Then he creates vinyl‚Äôs out of each layer after which with great care he applied to glass. Finally Jack adds the final touch a strip of LED lights, all of these things come
together to create a truly radiant artwork that explores light, colours and movement.\nIt was not until he helped forum Quite Useless that he released his own love for the visual arts. However jack‚Äôs process is a truly unique one, music runs deep in
his work. Thomson first writes a musical piece then after visualises the work around it. This is always attached to the work via a QR code. Which also affords the buyer and holder of the artwork certain rights to use the musical score, as long as
they still hold the art in their possession.\nJack started by creating scenes based on his own fascination with the roman republic. His debut collection based on such thoughts, was exhibited at the critically acclaimed London gallery and members

precision bringing the viewer into his world and letting us see moments of pure humanity shared between two people. Lockett worked with various mediums, like chalk and watercolour, however he always considered himself an oil painter and worked with
said medium more often.\n\nJohn studied human anatomy knowledge that clearly shows in his work. John often painted others but in two works he makes himself the subject, one painting is literal and the other figurative showing himself as expression
of his innermost angst. The backgrounds of John Luce‚Äôs pieces often take on a much more chaotic and colourful tone when compared to the foreground. Johns sense of humor and love of life is clearly shown in his work, for instance in his literal self
portrait he has the eyes arranged in a way that they follow you around the room.\n\nLockett was classically trained and attended The Byam Shaw, Kensington and The Northampton School of Art. His love of anatomy has always been a recurring theme in
his work. In 1998 John worked as medical illustrator for Mr Nigel Cobb, the now retired eminent orthopaedic surgeon. He also produced a series of drawings for an international lecture tour by Mr Cobb on his ground-breaking surgical technique:
‚ÄòTibialis Posterior Repair.‚Äô.\n\nHis love for romantic ideas lead John to paint Fletcher Christian, the Bounty mutineer, in 1995. This has become the accepted and most well known painting of Christian and was used in the book ‚ÄòFragile Paradise‚Äô by
Glynn Christian.\n\nAside from painting the female form, historic figures and human anatomy he also had a deep love of capturing clouds in his works of landscapes. In these works the clouds are painted in such a way that they take center stage shown
in a photorealist style one can not help but make comparisons between the manner in which the clouds are painted and the women that he painted.\n\nLockett‚Äôs most recent exhibitions included ‚ÄòNightHawks,‚Äô which were internationally exhibited by West
End Galleries, Florida and by LCA in both New York and Los Angeles.\n\nJohn is an internationally published artist and has worked with the Bentley Publishing Group in California U.S.A. for many years with open prints in worldwide distribution
through Leslie Levy Publishing. Signed limited edition prints are also available from LHG.\n\nJohn Luce Lockett passed away on the 9th of May 2014 after a long battle with cancer. What John left behind are wonderful memories shared by his friends
and family one of his friends said in regard to his upbeat personality\n\n‚ÄúWhenever I visited him during his illness years he was always cheerful and upbeat, obviously troubled deep down, but determined to ‚Äúcarry on as usual‚Äù, indeed he did just
that, continuing to paint and hold his regular drawing classes at his Northampton home.‚Äù\n\nAnother friend said in regard to John\n\n‚ÄúI will always recall his sense of humour and gentle manner. If he showed any pride at all it was probably reserved
for his son Billy, a talented musician. Thanks for all your advise and God Bless John. I know a lot of people will miss you.‚Äù\nIn short John left a lasting and significant impression on those he knew and those who were lucky enough to attend his
life drawing classes, inspiring countless artists and leaving a lasting impact on the art

said medium more often.\n\nJohn studied human anatomy knowledge that clearly shows in his work. John often painted others but in two works he makes himself the subject, one painting is literal and the other figurative showing himself as expression
of his innermost angst. The backgrounds of John Luce‚Äôs pieces often take on a much more chaotic and colourful tone when compared to the foreground. Johns sense of humor and love of life is clearly shown in his work, for instance in his literal self
portrait he has the eyes arranged in a way that they follow you around the room.\n\nLockett was classically trained and attended The Byam Shaw, Kensington and The Northampton School of Art. His love of anatomy has always been a recurring theme in
his work. In 1998 John worked as medical illustrator for Mr Nigel Cobb, the now retired eminent orthopaedic surgeon. He also produced a series of drawings for an international lecture tour by Mr Cobb on his ground-breaking surgical technique:
‚ÄòTibialis Posterior Repair.‚Äô.\n\nHis love for romantic ideas lead John to paint Fletcher Christian, the Bounty mutineer, in 1995. This has become the accepted and most well known painting of Christian and was used in the book ‚ÄòFragile Paradise‚Äô by
Glynn Christian.\n\nAside from painting the female form, historic figures and human anatomy he also had a deep love of capturing clouds in his works of landscapes. In these works the clouds are painted in such a way that they take center stage shown
in a photorealist style one can not help but make comparisons between the manner in which the clouds are painted and the women that he painted.\n\nLockett‚Äôs most recent exhibitions included ‚ÄòNightHawks,‚Äô which were internationally exhibited by West
End Galleries, Florida and by LCA in both New York and Los Angeles.\n\nJohn is an internationally published artist and has worked with the Bentley Publishing Group in California U.S.A. for many years with open prints in worldwide distribution

internationally exhibited by West End Galleries, Florida and by LCA in both New York and Los Angeles.\n\nJohn is an internationally published artist and has worked with the Bentley Publishing Group in California U.S.A. for many years with open
prints in worldwide distribution through Leslie Levy Publishing. Signed limited edition prints are also available from LHG.\n\nJohn Luce Lockett passed away on the 9th of May 2014 after a long battle with cancer. What John left behind are wonderful
memories shared by his friends and family one of his friends said in regard to his upbeat personality\n\n‚ÄúWhenever I visited him during his illness years he was always cheerful and upbeat, obviously troubled deep down, but determined to ‚Äúcarry on as
usual‚Äù, indeed he did just that, continuing to paint and hold his regular drawing classes at his Northampton home.‚Äù\n\nAnother friend said in regard to John\n\n‚ÄúI will always recall his sense of humour and gentle manner. If he showed any pride at
all it was probably reserved for his son Billy, a talented musician. Thanks for all your advise and God Bless John. I know a lot of people will miss you.‚Äù\nIn short John left a lasting and significant impression on those he knew and those who were
lucky enough to attend his life drawing classes, inspiring countless artists and leaving a lasting impact on the art world.

graduated with an MA in Visual Arts: Illustration from Camberwell College of Arts, University of the Arts London in 2017, receiving a Distinction.\nShe also studied BA (Hons) Creative Direction for Fashion at London college of Fashion between 2013
and 2015,\nand graduated in BFA Printmaking from the College of Fine Arts at Hongik University, Seoul, South Korea in 2013.\n\n\nDrawing on personal experience with inspiration from the human anatomy and\npsychoanalytic theory, I explore human
desire as a main subject matter alongside the\nconcept of life and death. Human desire and body are inextricably linked from birth until\ndeath in a continuous loop. In my theory, all things stem from desire; the object of desire\nvaries depending
on what a person craves and how desire appears throughout their lifetime.\nThe human figure is a recurring theme in my work and my obsession with the body started\nwhen I was young as I experienced a rare body condition and medical examinations
became\npart of my daily life. It was natural for me to be aware of the fragility of the human body and\nI began to channel its connection with the mind and desire into my works.\n \nI believe the consciousness and corporeality are inevitable
elements of human life. In diverse\nmedia my work attempts to embody the sublimation of the human desire into
perpetuity.","artworkCount":2,"avatarAssetId":"b6585a16-a845-49ff-972f-8735f4b82bea","id":"bef4677f-65b4-4cd7-a947-59766d3a4d45","dateModified":"2019-01-08T13:08:42.930637","dateCreated":"2018-12-06T01:56:04.847943"},"assetId":"d75c557b-4039-4059-b9c3-f8c2b8093ddf","asset":{"originalFilename":"Minju

bic-biro sketches filled his books and his vision began to flourished.\n\nIn the early-eighties, Sylvester became closely involved in the emerging London Hip-Hop scene. Strongly influenced by ‚ÄòSubway Art‚Äô an American book documenting graffiti on the
New York subways. Armed with sketchbooks loaded with anti-heroes and paranoid robot illustrations, and a new source of creative inspiration, he began to transfer his off key creations from the books to the walls.\n\nBy his mid teens, he had already
considered himself a well rounded artist gaining a reputation in the underground graffiti scene. Running with Saker-DDS-PFB-TKS-MGM, a North London graffiti crews.\n\nSylvester was commissioned to work on the video set of ‚Äò3 That‚Äôs The Magic Number‚Äô
for the New York rap trio De La Soul. For this he designed and painted stop animations caricatures of members Trugoy, Pusdnous and Prince Paul, throughout the video. This success would be followed with a commissioned by ‚ÄòSwatch‚Äô. He would paint the

in which he almost severed his right arm. Losing most of his nerve functions as a result, he began training to paint with his left hand. He succeeded and his straight lined cross-hatch style started to evolve as a result.\n\nNow ambidextrous and
determined to continue on with his work and progression of style. Ollie‚Äôs works began to move further from his more figure-based works, inspired by his mood and setting. Ollie‚Äôs older works have darker, more constructed feel to them. His more recent
pieces take on a happier more chaotic design. The ordered lines have been replaced with curves and focuses on one central colour.\n\nHis caricatures began to brandish a more joyous tone. As a truly evolving and experimental artist, he often splashes
his work with Guinness. The dark drips causing an almost oxidised effect and adding to the overall dark beauty of his works.\n\nThe unique imagery of his work would catch the eye of the Chinese government. They would sponsor and commission him to

dyslexia, he found himself focused more on doodling then his curriculum. As he found himself at the back of his academic courses, his interests in art began to take precedent. With his initial inspirations coming from Lego and Marvel comics.\n\nHis
bic-biro sketches filled his books and his vision began to flourished.\n\nIn the early-eighties, Sylvester became closely involved in the emerging London Hip-Hop scene. Strongly influenced by ‚ÄòSubway Art‚Äô an American book documenting graffiti on the
New York subways. Armed with sketchbooks loaded with anti-heroes and paranoid robot illustrations, and a new source of creative inspiration, he began to transfer his off key creations from the books to the walls.\n\nBy his mid teens, he had already
considered himself a well rounded artist gaining a reputation in the underground graffiti scene. Running with Saker-DDS-PFB-TKS-MGM, a North London graffiti crews.\n\nSylvester was commissioned to work on the video set of ‚Äò3 That‚Äôs The Magic Number‚Äô
for the New York rap trio De La Soul. For this he designed and painted stop animations caricatures of members Trugoy, Pusdnous and Prince Paul, throughout the video. This success would be followed with a commissioned by ‚ÄòSwatch‚Äô. He would paint the
Qxford Street branch shop to launch their Orange Feather Swatch Watch.\n\nIn 1987 Sylvster was introduction to the ‚Äòacid house‚Äô scene would begin to take an integral part in his inspiration for his work. The more dubious side of rave culture and
urban life would translate to the more darker tone in his work. Soon he would transition his work from the urban walls of London to the canvas.\n\nAs Sylvester continued his work, an unfortunate event would befall in 1994. Ollie suffered an accident
in which he almost severed his right arm. Losing most of his nerve functions as a result, he began training to paint with his left hand. He succeeded and his straight lined cross-hatch style started to evolve as a result.\n\nNow ambidextrous and
determined to continue on with his work and progression of style. Ollie‚Äôs works began to move further from his more figure-based works, inspired by his mood and setting. Ollie‚Äôs older works have darker, more constructed feel to them. His more recent
pieces take on a happier more chaotic design. The ordered lines have been replaced with curves and focuses on one central colour.\n\nHis caricatures began to brandish a more joyous tone. As a truly evolving and experimental artist, he often splashes
his work with Guinness. The dark drips causing an almost oxidised effect and adding to the overall dark beauty of his works.\n\nThe unique imagery of his work would catch the eye of the Chinese government. They would sponsor and commission him to
come to China. Ollie then painted a cinematic size artwork at the 2007 Shenzhen Biennale of Urbanism and Architecture.\n\nWith a colourful and fascinating journey into the world of art and a multitude of mediums and an ever evolving image. Ollie
Sylvester has proven himself to be a would-be legend in the street art community. His work is easily a unique talent to be recognised in the art world.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure that art collage could have livened me up to new mediums and techniques and

Bailey","email":"baileysascha@gmail.com","about":"Paloma grew up in South West England, in a small town called Tavistock. Her name is derived from the Latin word ‚ÄúPalumbus‚Äù, which means ‚ÄúDove‚Äù or ‚ÄúHoly Spirit‚Äù and Paloma Lola Bailey has truly
assimilated these qualities into her life.\n\nPaloma‚Äôs paintings show us the difficulty of remaining uncorrupted in this world. The works featured center upon aspects of deep, personal angst. All artists draw from experience, but with Paloma we find
these accentuated. Struggling with a confined education system, Paloma would leave school soon after A-Levels in order to forge her own path in the world.\n\nWith clear influences from Francis Bacon and Picasso, she finds comfort in the desperation
of the human condition. She would tell you that these paintings are a representation of what she saw in the people closest to her. Painted in oils, scored with emotion.\nPaloma has recently had three children; Samir, Sofia and Isabella, who her
latest work is inspired by. They depict her children whilst still in the womb, bringing beautiful vibrancy to their most vulnerable
state.\n\n","artworkCount":3,"avatarAssetId":"88888888-8888-8888-8888-888888888888","id":"26076919-f58f-4f56-806b-2dde20a93319","dateModified":"2018-12-27T11:40:31.497645","dateCreated":"2018-12-27T11:05:07.117646"},"assetId":"4eef54c9-eb7e-421c-a5ac-58e72f17f37b","asset":{"originalFilename":"anger.jpg","fileFormat":"image/jpeg","length":16988776,"id":"4eef54c9-eb7e-421c-a5ac-58e72f17f37b","dateModified":"2018-12-27T11:40:27.266483","dateCreated":"2018-12-27T11:40:27.266483"},"ownerUserId":"60ce5753-da0a-46d7-aa39-d526aa196a93","ownerUser":{"username":"BAE

Psychedelia Rug","artistId":"01d02cf9-fd90-44ad-afa2-c775d3e933a9","artist":{"name":"Taline Temizian","about":"Taline Temizian (b. 1978, USA) practices a transhumanist perspective on memory and trauma by investigating the different modes through
which neurological activity contributes to lived experience. Temizian works to depict a place of memory situated between a state of mind and physical reality, manifesting complexed networks comprised of scientific methodologies, conceptual
discourses and personal narratives. \n\nEmploying multiple processes and media, Temizian presents raw yet technically intricate objects and installations that produce bold sensory and emotional experiences. Interrogating the transhumanist promise of
eternal and idyllic life through science and technology, Temizian applies an artist and poet‚Äôs touch to these vocabularies in order to reformat connections between personal history, physical and metaphysical conceptions of humanity. Currently based
in London, with projects across Europe, Temizian‚Äôs practice often sees her collaborating with philosophers, scientists, technologists and filmmakers in pursuit of her creative goals.\n\n \n\n‚Äù The art practice of Taline Temizian combines live feed
imagery and prerecorded modifiable imagery with works in traditional disciplines such as painting and sculpture which she infuses into multi-mediumal constellations on an architectural dimension. Her works are situational, i.e., dependent and
activated through and by the concrete movement of the viewer in time and space, but at the same time they are also confessional and personal, the outcome of processing biographical source materials. Temizian‚Äôs works are phenomenological as well as
representational, juxtaposing experiential with pictorial entities.\n\nIn her work Temizian parallels between technological mechanisms and psychophysical mechanisms. She is elaborating on the physical implications of circulating technologically
modifiable imagery through and between communication networks and representation systems. Temizian relies on art-historical contexts and on scientific discourses. More than objects or painterly/sculptural installations, her works can be considered a
sort of habitats, living areas which make no distinction between the animate and the inanimate, the virtual and the material, the living and the dead. In addition, Temizian‚Äôs art practice transcends and blurs the difference between ‚Äòhere and now‚Äô
and ‚Äòthere and then‚Äô, creating an altered zone that intermixes a variety of times, places and forms of being, into an indeterminate heterogenous state of things. ‚Äú\n\nFrom ORY DESSAU, Pavilions of Memory: On TALINE TEMIZIAN‚Äôs recent body of work.

Taline Temizian (b. 1978, USA) practices a transhumanist perspective on memory and trauma by investigating the different modes through which neurological activity contributes to lived experience. Temizian works to depict a place of memory situated
between a state of mind and physical reality, manifesting complexed networks comprised of scientific methodologies, conceptual discourses and personal narratives. \n\nEmploying multiple processes and media, Temizian presents raw yet technically
intricate objects and installations that produce bold sensory and emotional experiences. Interrogating the transhumanist promise of eternal and idyllic life through science and technology, Temizian applies an artist and poet‚Äôs touch to these
vocabularies in order to reformat connections between personal history, physical and metaphysical conceptions of humanity. Currently based in London, with projects across Europe, Temizian‚Äôs practice often sees her collaborating with philosophers,
scientists, technologists and filmmakers in pursuit of her creative goals.\n\n \n\n‚Äù The art practice of Taline Temizian combines live feed imagery and prerecorded modifiable imagery with works in traditional disciplines such as painting and
sculpture which she infuses into multi-mediumal constellations on an architectural dimension. Her works are situational, i.e., dependent and activated through and by the concrete movement of the viewer in time and space, but at the same time they
are also confessional and personal, the outcome of processing biographical source materials. Temizian‚Äôs works are phenomenological as well as representational, juxtaposing experiential with pictorial entities.\n\nIn her work Temizian parallels
between technological mechanisms and psychophysical mechanisms. She is elaborating on the physical implications of circulating technologically modifiable imagery through and between communication networks and representation systems. Temizian relies
on art-historical contexts and on scientific discourses. More than objects or painterly/sculptural installations, her works can be considered a sort of habitats, living areas which make no distinction between the animate and the inanimate, the
virtual and the material, the living and the dead. In addition, Temizian‚Äôs art practice transcends and blurs the difference between ‚Äòhere and now‚Äô and ‚Äòthere and then‚Äô, creating an altered zone that intermixes a variety of times, places and forms of
being, into an indeterminate heterogenous state of things.

Taline Temizian (b. 1978, USA) practices a transhumanist perspective on memory and trauma by investigating the different modes through which neurological activity contributes to lived experience. Temizian works to depict a place of memory situated
between a state of mind and physical reality, manifesting complexed networks comprised of scientific methodologies, conceptual discourses and personal narratives. \n\nEmploying multiple processes and media, Temizian presents raw yet technically
intricate objects and installations that produce bold sensory and emotional experiences. Interrogating the transhumanist promise of eternal and idyllic life through science and technology, Temizian applies an artist and poet‚Äôs touch to these
vocabularies in order to reformat connections between personal history, physical and metaphysical conceptions of humanity. Currently based in London, with projects across Europe, Temizian‚Äôs practice often sees her collaborating with philosophers,
scientists, technologists and filmmakers in pursuit of her creative goals.\n\n \n\n‚Äù The art practice of Taline Temizian combines live feed imagery and prerecorded modifiable imagery with works in traditional disciplines such as painting and
sculpture which she infuses into multi-mediumal constellations on an architectural dimension. Her works are situational, i.e., dependent and activated through and by the concrete movement of the viewer in time and space, but at the same time they
are also confessional and personal, the outcome of processing biographical source materials. Temizian‚Äôs works are phenomenological as well as representational, juxtaposing experiential with pictorial entities.\n\nIn her work Temizian parallels
between technological mechanisms and psychophysical mechanisms. She is elaborating on the physical implications of circulating technologically modifiable imagery through and between communication networks and representation systems. Temizian relies
on art-historical contexts and on scientific discourses. More than objects or painterly/sculptural installations, her works can be considered a sort of habitats, living areas which make no distinction between the animate and the inanimate, the
virtual and the material, the living and the dead. In addition, Temizian‚Äôs art practice transcends and blurs the difference between ‚Äòhere and now‚Äô and ‚Äòthere and then‚Äô, creating an altered zone that intermixes a variety of times, places and forms of
being, into an indeterminate heterogenous state of things.

Taline Temizian (b. 1978, USA) practices a transhumanist perspective on memory and trauma by investigating the different modes through which neurological activity contributes to lived experience. Temizian works to depict a place of memory situated
between a state of mind and physical reality, manifesting complexed networks comprised of scientific methodologies, conceptual discourses and personal narratives. \n\nEmploying multiple processes and media, Temizian presents raw yet technically
intricate objects and installations that produce bold sensory and emotional experiences. Interrogating the transhumanist promise of eternal and idyllic life through science and technology, Temizian applies an artist and poet‚Äôs touch to these
vocabularies in order to reformat connections between personal history, physical and metaphysical conceptions of humanity. Currently based in London, with projects across Europe, Temizian‚Äôs practice often sees her collaborating with philosophers,
scientists, technologists and filmmakers in pursuit of her creative goals.\n\n \n\n‚Äù The art practice of Taline Temizian combines live feed imagery and prerecorded modifiable imagery with works in traditional disciplines such as painting and
sculpture which she infuses into multi-mediumal constellations on an architectural dimension. Her works are situational, i.e., dependent and activated through and by the concrete movement of the viewer in time and space, but at the same time they
are also confessional and personal, the outcome of processing biographical source materials. Temizian‚Äôs works are phenomenological as well as representational, juxtaposing experiential with pictorial entities.\n\nIn her work Temizian parallels
between technological mechanisms and psychophysical mechanisms. She is elaborating on the physical implications of circulating technologically modifiable imagery through and between communication networks and representation systems. Temizian relies
on art-historical contexts and on scientific discourses. More than objects or painterly/sculptural installations, her works can be considered a sort of habitats, living areas which make no distinction between the animate and the inanimate, the
virtual and the material, the living and the dead. In addition, Temizian‚Äôs art practice transcends and blurs the difference between ‚Äòhere and now‚Äô and ‚Äòthere and then‚Äô, creating an altered zone that intermixes a variety of times, places and forms of
being, into an indeterminate heterogenous state of things.

hearted and satirical, a style that best describe him as well. He seems to draw his inspiration from the world around him with cult movies and cartoons having a heavy influence in the development of his work. When Speaking on his creative process he
says ‚ÄúEver since I was a wee lad I have been drawing characters and making my own toys. What I do now is an extension of what I‚Äôve been doing all along.‚Äù\n\nTom has a fantastically vivid imagination and extravagant view of life, which he uses not
only in his digital work but also in his short films, continuing his outlandish and colourful eye in his life.\n\nTom left school at sixteen to pursue work stating that ‚Äúlearning doesn‚Äôt end at the school gates.‚Äù

to verbally communicate in his younger years William chose instead\nto express himself pictorially and physically through the inspiration of the great\nexpressionist painters Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse and Van Gogh. He is an artist who\nuses
photography and Painting as a means of communication, by integrating paint\nwith photograph he gives the ability to add multiple points of perspective. What we\nperceive is not what we necessarily see when we live in a world which holds no
truths\nand no answers, only beliefs. His belief is in seeing more and showing both a physical\ntruth and an emotive honesty. Photography holds as many lies as truths so by\nsynthesizing painting with photographs he projects a visualisation that
captures both\nthe instant, and the immortal.\nAfter graduating from his photography degree William decided to move to NYC to\npursue his fine art roots. Finding stimulation within the new, coming from a small\nhamlet village to the big apple, a
life juxtaposition that shaped William‚Äôs psyche.\nFinding a political satirical cutting edge within his work, which resonates in his work\nstill. All great things must come to an end after a year living as an artist in NYC, William\nwas caught
selling his art, at which breaking his visa voucher and ultimately getting\nhimself deported.\nHe quickly moved to Berlin to continue his art work within a top grade Artist\nResidency, Galerie 102 on Potsdamerstr. Berlin. The Berlin work which came
and\nwhich is continued is based around nudes and flowers. Unlike familiar images of the\nfemale nude, like Titian's \"Venus of Urbino\" which demonstrates both domesticity\nand sexualisation as example to women and for the pleasure of men, William
has been\nfocusing, looking and seeing the individual truth and empowering the beauty of her\nform, the exterior world coloured with flowers from which she emerges untouched\nnever doubting her inner strength. William is currently exploring new

my work. I was diagnosed with a severe speech disorder at a\nyoung age. Expressing an emotion was near impossible through words, which is why\nI picked up a brush and pencil and took to the hills. The only language I know to date\nis on a visual
level.‚Äù\nWilliam Grob 13/11/1992\nWilliam Grob takes many influences from the rural aesthetic he was raised in with his\ninfluences originating from natural elements, ornate stonework and his carnal intrigue\nof fire. Struggling to verbally
communicate in his younger years William chose instead\nto express himself pictorially and physically through the inspiration of the great\nexpressionist painters Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse and Van Gogh. He is an artist who\nuses photography and
Painting as a means of communication, by integrating paint\nwith photograph he gives the ability to add multiple points of perspective. What we\nperceive is not what we necessarily see when we live in a world which holds no truths\nand no answers,
only beliefs. His belief is in seeing more and showing both a physical\ntruth and an emotive honesty. Photography holds as many lies as truths so by\nsynthesizing painting with photographs he projects a visualisation that captures both\nthe instant,
and the immortal.\nAfter graduating from his photography degree William decided to move to NYC to\npursue his fine art roots. Finding stimulation within the new, coming from a small\nhamlet village to the big apple, a life juxtaposition that shaped
William‚Äôs psyche.\nFinding a political satirical cutting edge within his work, which resonates in his work\nstill. All great things must come to an end after a year living as an artist in NYC, William\nwas caught selling his art, at which breaking
his visa voucher and ultimately getting\nhimself deported.\nHe quickly moved to Berlin to continue his art work within a top grade Artist\nResidency, Galerie 102 on Potsdamerstr. Berlin. The Berlin work which came and\nwhich is continued is based
around nudes and flowers. Unlike familiar images of the\nfemale nude, like Titian's \"Venus of Urbino\" which demonstrates both domesticity\nand sexualisation as example to women and for the pleasure of men, William has been\nfocusing, looking and
seeing the individual truth and empowering the beauty of her\nform, the exterior world coloured with flowers from which she emerges untouched\nnever doubting her inner strength. William is currently exploring new mediums on\nphotographs and trying
to find his next style.\n\nEducation;\nGraduated BA Photography at Falmouth University 2011 ‚Äì 2014\n\nResidency;\nGalerie 102, Berlin, 2016\n\nExhibitions\nLondon ‚Äì 2019 ‚Äì Ransom Art (TBA) Solo Show\nBerlin -2018 ‚Äì ExGirlfriend (TBA NOV) ‚Äì Group

level.‚Äù\nWilliam Grob 13/11/1992\nWilliam Grob takes many influences from the rural aesthetic he was raised in with his\ninfluences originating from natural elements, ornate stonework and his carnal intrigue\nof fire. Struggling to verbally
communicate in his younger years William chose instead\nto express himself pictorially and physically through the inspiration of the great\nexpressionist painters Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse and Van Gogh. He is an artist who\nuses photography and
Painting as a means of communication, by integrating paint\nwith photograph he gives the ability to add multiple points of perspective. What we\nperceive is not what we necessarily see when we live in a world which holds no truths\nand no answers,
only beliefs. His belief is in seeing more and showing both a physical\ntruth and an emotive honesty. Photography holds as many lies as truths so by\nsynthesizing painting with photographs he projects a visualisation that captures both\nthe instant,
and the immortal.\nAfter graduating from his photography degree William decided to move to NYC to\npursue his fine art roots. Finding stimulation within the new, coming from a small\nhamlet village to the big apple, a life juxtaposition that shaped
William‚Äôs psyche.\nFinding a political satirical cutting edge within his work, which resonates in his work\nstill. All great things must come to an end after a year living as an artist in NYC, William\nwas caught selling his art, at which breaking
his visa voucher and ultimately getting\nhimself deported.\nHe quickly moved to Berlin to continue his art work within a top grade Artist\nResidency, Galerie 102 on Potsdamerstr. Berlin. The Berlin work which came and\nwhich is continued is based
around nudes and flowers. Unlike familiar images of the\nfemale nude, like Titian's \"Venus of Urbino\" which demonstrates both domesticity\nand sexualisation as example to women and for the pleasure of men, William has been\nfocusing, looking and
seeing the individual truth and empowering the beauty of her\nform, the exterior world coloured with flowers from which she emerges untouched\nnever doubting her inner strength. William is currently exploring new mediums on\nphotographs and trying
to find his next style.\n\nEducation;\nGraduated BA Photography at Falmouth University 2011 ‚Äì 2014\n\nResidency;\nGalerie 102, Berlin, 2016\n\nExhibitions\nLondon ‚Äì 2019 ‚Äì Ransom Art (TBA) Solo Show\nBerlin -2018 ‚Äì ExGirlfriend (TBA NOV) ‚Äì Group

in art and illustration, which led her to start her artistic high school studies. In this stage, her art starts to germinate and it starts the profiling process which will bring her where she is today. One of the aspects which have helped in this

emotional half. However, as she grew, Lynn ends up being fully profiled. Currently, Zyralynn‚Äôs artstyle is characterized by the illustration of alien and extra-terrestrial lifeforms but in a non-conventional way. The artist makes an effort to
explore the humanization of the exotic and the feared in order to sensualize it. With this style, the intention is to make these creatures adopt human attitudes, generating a feeling of identification with the observed being. \n\nAn unexpected
feeling of calm (and, until a certain point, unknown) rises because of this merge between the familiarity of the human traits and physiognomy, and the apparent unrecognizability of the monstrous shapes and forms. Likewise, Zyralynn does not
illustrate faces, since her pretention is to avoid the representation of someone in particular while everybody is being represented. Thereby, she tries to bring closer the rarity and uniqueness of her art to everyone.\n\nRegarding the technique, the
artist is very concerned about details, but she keeps simultaneously a somewhat chaotic nature in her stroke, which is quite characteristic of her. This drawn chaos has a direct reflex with the foggy chaos residing inside her head. However, it is
more important the artistic side than the technical one, but the main goal is nonetheless to achieve a reasonable balance between both (which does not necessarily mean they are at the same level). It is for this reason that the personal style of
every artist fills with meaning and value the original
